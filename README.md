## Our Product

</p>

*stalkr* is a simple–yet powerful–set of tools which gathers data from both continuous integration and application infrastructure monitoring tools in order to make it easier to monitor the whole developing process, in a way the entire team can see at a glance, from the very first commit to the final release.

Although our experimental release is a simple client made for the Apple TV, we do intend to make *stalkr* clients available on as much platforms as possible, which include:

- Other **Smart TV** platforms–e.g. Android TV, webOS, Tizen etc.;

- **SmartWatch** platforms–e.g. watchOS, Android Wear etc.;

- Popular **Mobile** platforms–e.g. iOS, Android etc.;

- Popular **Desktop** OSs–e.g. macOS, Linux, Windows etc.;

- The **Web** itself.

[`config.json`](/src/config.json) file and change the value of variables.

### Workflow

All the tasks needed for development automation are defined in the

`npm run <command>`
